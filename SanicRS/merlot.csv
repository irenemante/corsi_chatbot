The site is introduced with the the following: Academic perspectives on the psychology of transsexuality are represented by groups like the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) and are codified in the mental illness model of the DSM-IV-TR as Gender Identity Disorder (GID) and Transvestic Fetishism (TF). This psychopathology treats transsexuality and cross-dressing as inherently bad things about us. Theyre not. Gender bending, gender queers, and transgenderism show society how uncomfortable it is trying to understanding gender and sexuality. Can sexologists refrain from placing value judgements upon those with gender dysphoria and instead refine the way we understand the psychology of gender, atypical gender development, and gender role socialization? I hope that by bringing a personal and non-judgemental scientific approach to understanding transgenderism, I can help transsexuals, cross-dressers, and psychopathologists grow and develop as people.;Reference Material;English;Bassa;;0-30;['College General Ed'];18;20;

It also reports the complexity of transforming such ideas or conceptions. Knowing students previous ideas is an important issue for the development of teaching programs and books, as well as for developing teaching strategies and for identifying students? conceptual progress. This knowledge is also important for researchers who, analyzing students representations about natural phenomena and scientific concepts, propose forms of interpreting and changing them. For these reasons, it becomes imperative to display here what is missing or unfinished in this matter and to notice what research would do about it. The main objectives of this group are: (1) Put at the reach of science teachers of different educational levels, students previous ideas in biology, physics and chemistry in the form of a database. (2) Put forward the diversity of the previous ideas shown by students, teachers and textbooks, as well as the themes that have been analyzed or not in the research literature within each scientific discipline. (3) Offer an analysis of previous ideas that would allow teachers to identify possible conceptual and representational problems, within each of the different themes approached in teaching natural sciences.

Some are simple misunderstandings; ideas that develop in the course of learning about evolution, possibly from school experiences and/or from the media. Other misconceptions may stem from purposeful attempts to interfere with the teaching of evolution. Science teachers must learn to treat all student questions with respect and initially to accept each question as the reflection of a legitimate desire to learn. However, some questions may well be designed to disrupt the learning process. We need to deal with intentionally disruptive questions in ways that are a bit different from legitimate inquiry. And it is important that we learn to distinguish between the two.

Once inside a human, the parasite develops and multiplies, causing periodic bouts of flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, and chills. The developing parasites destroy red blood cells, which may cause death by severe anemia as well as by the clogging of capillaries that supply the brain or other vital organs with blood. The deadliest of the four species of the parasite is Plasmodium falciparum, a species most likely to be transmitted by the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. The genomes of humans, A. gambiae, and P. falciparum have recently been sequenced, and hopefully this information will point the way to new avenues of vaccination, treatment, or eradication of this disease.;Tutorial;English;Media;Website;30-60;['College General Ed'];18;20;

Since 1998, the Paper Project has been exploring the structure and beauty of paper. The project chronicles handmade and mouldmade paper through images produced by scanning electron microscopy and a scanning-laser confocal microscope. The content blends the world of art and science. Teaching standards addressed include K-8 visual arts, technology, and science. It reveals how science, art, and technology are entwined and would be appropriate material for cross-disciplinary integrated teaching by faculty who team teach at the middle school level. The development of this site began with a simple scientific question - What can modern microscopy tell us about paper? - and it has grown in many different directions from that point. Materials include written comparisons of old and new technology (the history of microsopes, the history of paper), step-by-step instructions for making paper, and microscopic images of paper with depth resolution or at various magnifications displayed side-by-side for easy comparison (powers of 10: 100x and 1000x).

In topic 1, students learn how blood glucose, pH, and other variables are maintained at stable levels by homeostasis, and what conditions result from imbalances in the variables. Students follow Ben, a fellow âstudent,â through a bad day in which they interpret Benâs physiological reactions and determine how his organs and organ systems will interact to restore his homeostasis. Students encounter realistic, yet humorous situations that lead to changes in Benâs blood pressure, pH, glucose, osmolarity, and body temperature. They then select the appropriate physiological inputs that will restore Benâs homeostasis in each situation. In topic 2, students dive deep inside Ben to learn how messenger molecules of the nervous and endocrine system were working to carry signals throughout Benâs body to restore his homeostasis in the previous topic. Students 1) step through animations of signaling between nervous and endocrine systems and target organs, learning which signals are fast and which are slow; 2) label events in a signal relay between the brain, pituitary gland, and kidney; and 3) classify descriptions of neurotransmitters or hormones based on properties such as receptor specificity and delivery to target organs. In topic 3, students learn about negative feedback regulation of glucose and play the role of doctor to determine if Ben has diabetes. Students will: 1) learn about symptoms and causes of diabetes; 2) step through an animation depicting feedback regulation by insulin; and 3) exercise their clinical thinking skills by completing a case study in which they examine Benâs symptoms and family history of diabetes, interpret the result of his glucose tolerance test, and answer his questions about his condition and treatment options.";Simulation;English;Medio bassa;;30-60;['College General Ed'];18;20;

These courses will help teachers better understand the science concepts that underlie the content they teach. The sessions include a video program addressing a topic area related to matter that is likely to be part of any elementary school science curriculum. Essential Science for Teachers: Physical Science also focuses on the ideas that children bring to the classroom about these topics. Children in a clinical setting are interviewed and observed to uncover their thinking. The research literature shows that their ideas are typical of students in the K-6 age group. Each session also features one or more elementary school classrooms where a teacher and her students explore the topic using exemplary curriculum materials. Physical Science strives to provide participants not only with enhanced content understandings, but also with understandings of how this content connects to the elementary school classroom.;Presentation;English;Medio bassa;Website;60-90;['Grade School', 'College General Ed', 'Graduate School', 'Professional'];6;100;

As you look around this cell things should look real, however they are models that are only an approximation of the real things. And since we do not want to deceive you, but teach you, we included real electron micrographs. Look at them and keep in touch with reality.

I am not an ESL teacher or a professional linguist. In fact, English is my second language and I am still learning it. I started this page a long time ago (in 1997) as an ESL bookmark page, and itâs kind of grown from there. Since I do web programming - I do maintain these pages to help other ESL learners. Obviously, I can not write articles with tips on better writing or advice on grammar and usage... However, I believe my spelling words tests and English reading help tools can be useful for you in learning English as a second language. There are also links to other online Quizzes and Exercises, Listening, ESL Books, Grammar, Writing and Reading ESL resources, links for ESL teachers and links for ESL students with information on ESL Programs and College scholarships, Grants, Student Loans and financial aid.

It highlights the value of the community-based learning approach to improving academic outcomes, including test scores, attendance rates, and graduation rates, as well as civic, moral, personal, social, and work-related outcomes. Research shows that as many as 60% of all students are disengaged from learning and that this is a key factor in the dropout rate. How do we combat this disengagement? Community-based Learning addresses these issues by involving students in real-world problem solving that ignites the imagination and the intellect of our young people. It sparks students passion for learning and prepare them for success and citizenship. As highlighted in this paper, studies have shown that students who are involved in this approach have increased attendance rates, improved academic outcomes and are more likely to graduate on time.;Reference Material;English;Media;PDF;0-30;['Middle School', 'High School', 'College General Ed', 'Professional'];11;100;

(GRAVITY LESSON);CDE Standards for Grade 2 (Physical Sciences 2E) deal with gravity. So does this fun and cool website! Try it out with the kids and then explain the text as needed. As an intro to the site, Isaac Newton was a great scientist and mathematician who lived more than 300 years ago. He understood and wrote about many of the laws of motion that we see at work every day. To explain how one body can orbit another, he asked his readers to imagine a cannon on top of a very, VERY tall mountain. (Our cannon is on a very tall, imaginary lifter that goes up and down, but it is the same idea.) The cannon is loaded with gunpowder and fired. The cannonball follows a curve, falling faster and faster as a result of Earths gravity, and hits the Earth at some distance away.;Simulation;English;Media;Shockwave;120;['Grade School'];6;11;

In addition, the IUCN Red List also lists all the taxa that have been evaluated and are considered to be non-threatened i.e. are listed as Least Concern.

The recently released Version 3 of CmapTools takes concept mapping to a new level, providing a powerful means for collaboratively creating, organizing, evaluating, and sharing knowledge models distributed on a growing collection of servers throughout the world, or on your private server. Among a large set of new features, a redesigned, simple user interface enables users to share their knowledge and link their concept maps to those of others with simple drag-and-drop operations. The synchronous collaboration tool allows geographically dispersed participants to concurrently work on the same Cmap, and see the others changes in real time. The act of storing a Cmap on a CmapTools server actually stores a copy as a Web page, making it fast and automatic to share your Cmap(s) in an easily viewable, read-only form to the world at large. Styles make it easy to give a common look to a set of concept maps, including background images. In addition to English, this new version brings a user interface in Italian and Portuguese (other languages are in the works). The ability to search throughout all concept maps in servers across the world and resources (images, web pages, etc.) on the Web provides the power to change how users retrieve information: the tool leverages the topology and semantics of the concept map to retrieve from the Web and concept map index servers only resources that are relevant to the content of the user?s map. IHMCs CmapTools is being used by thousands of users from corporations, government entities, universities and schools since the early 1990s. Users include NASA, the US Navy, the Electric Power Research Institute, the Department of Defense, and thousands of teachers and students from universities and schools from over 150 countries. It has been shown to be an effective mechanism to capture and share the tacit knowledge of experts, as well as a powerful assessment and collaboration tool in schools. The CmapTools software continues to be free for non-for-profit, educational use.;Quiz/Test;English;Media;;120;['Grade School', 'Middle School', 'High School', 'College General Ed', 'Professional'];6;100;

I have just launched a free new web site -- http://www.makebeliefscomix.com -- where students can create their own comic strips. The site offers fun animal and human characters with different moods, thought and talk balloons to fill in with words, and story prompts. Its a wonderful resource to spur children and adults to write, read and communicate their ideas and to practice English and other languages. It is also being used as a tool by educational therapists who work with deaf and autistic people to help them understand concepts and communicate. I would be very appreciative if you would share with your members and colleagues, or tell me whom I should contact to share this information. I need your help because it takes a community to build a community resource like this. With thanks, Bill Zimmerman Online Educational Comics Launched to Encourage Writing, Reading and Communication By Author/Journalist Bill Zimmerman ?- http://www.makebeliefscomix.com Dear reader, I want to share with you news of my newest educational project and also ask for your help to make it succeed. I?ve just launched a new web site -- http:// www.makebeliefscomix.com -- where children and adults can create their own comic strips. They can select from 10 fun characters with different moods -- happy, sad, angry, worried ? and write words for blank talk and thought balloons to make their characters talk and think. There also are story ideas and prompts to help users create graphic stories. This site can be used by educators to teach language, reading and writing skills, and also for students in English-as-a-Second-Language programs to facilitate self-expression and storytelling. Some educational therapists use it with deaf and autistic people to help them understand concepts and communicate. Parents and children can create stories together, print them to create comic books or email them to friends and family. Others will find the site a resource to be creative, calm down and have fun. I am hoping that you will share http://www.makebeliefscomix.com with your colleagues, teachers, students or readers of your publications and resource lists. The site is free with no advertising. Any help you might offer in getting word out about this project is very appreciated. If you can suggest other people or groups whom I might contact to make them aware of the site please send me their names, email addresses or phone numbers. Relevant Internet resource sharing groups would be helpful, too. It takes a community to build a useful resource like this one. As one who learned to read with comic books, I know that creating comic strips can help people tap into their creativity and practice their language and storytelling skills. The site is free and stems from my lifelong mission to create resources that help people find their voice and express themselves. The concept for makebeliefscomix.com is derived from my earlier books, Make Beliefs and Make Beliefs for Kids of All Ages (which can be found on my other web site: http://www.billztreasurechest.com). A Make Beliefs interactive feature appeared for 13 years on my syndicated Student Briefing Page for Newsday, and in National Geographic?s World Magazine. I hope you like http://www.makebeliefscomix.com and will use it in your work and personal life. Your feedback is welcome and very helpful.

But if that was her motive, why did she stay to help her mistress save her possessions instead of fleeing? True she confessed but only after torture. Her punishment was to be hanged and then burnt. But did she really start the fire? What does her story tell us about slavery, torture and fire in early Canada?

Podcasts give students a new way to receive and present information and can engage students in the material by allowing them to be active composers in an emerging technology. Assignments that require students to produce their own class podcasts not only actively engages them in synthesizing course content and exposes them to a new mode of composing but also provides a critical opportunity for them to reflect upon the needs and expectations of their audience and how to reach that audience via the rhetorical elements specific to the medium. Writing centers can use podcasts to disseminate information about writing to current and potential clients and to reach a wide audience of instructors and practitioners of writing. Finally, podcasts can expand our professional community in composition studies beyond the temporal and spatial constraints inherent in the age-old academic conference model. In each of these examples, podcasts are most effective only when they are instructionally sound and when they provide content that adequately addresses the intended audience.;Reference Material;English;Medio bassa;Audio;0-30;['High School', 'College General Ed', 'College Lower Division', 'College Upper Division', 'Graduate School', 'Professional'];14;100;

The lessons use the aquatic environment and real lake data to explore basic science concepts through two different approaches: a directed study (Studying) and an inquiry (Investigating) approach. The directed studies allow students to apply and learn concepts through direct, guided experience. The inquiry lessons provide a more open-ended opportunity for students to discover the same concepts. This module was selected as the 2005 Classics Award Winner of the Biology Discipline because it allows students to analyze real environmental data collected in several lakes over long periods of time. In addition the site provides sound pedagogical tools to help the students apply basic scientific concepts to analyze and understand the data.;Collection;English;Media;;60-90;['College General Ed'];18;20;

Training designers have to be able to design effective eLearning to meet those needs. This is difficult because designing successful eLearning is part art and part science, involving the use of learning and training theory and an understanding of the knowledge and/or skills to be taught. The design also has to be completed within the constraints involved in all phases of the training design and implementation. Further complicating the process is the diversity of equipment, tools, and techniques involved. A final complication is the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the design of eLearning. Each course is unique. However, there is a general process whereby the designer balances the elements involved. If the designer does everything correctly, there is a greatly improved chance that the result will be effective eLearning.;Open (Access) Journal-Article;English;Bassa;;0-30;['College Lower Division', 'College Upper Division', 'Graduate School'];20;28;

In topic 2, students construct chemiosmosis pathways in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Students will: 1) select the correct components (electron donor and acceptor, ETC, ATP synthase) and place them in the appropriate subcellular location ; 2) apply concepts about redox reactions, concentration gradients, and energetics to explain how chemiosmosis fits in a cellâs overall metabolism; and 3)summarize properties of chemiosmosis in organelles and Parcoccus denitificans. In topic 3, students follow the evolution of chemiosmosis and the role it played in the evolution of cellular life.

In topic 1, students make decisions for a paramecium living in a Petri dish that will determine if it will have enough energy to survive and reproduce. Students will 1) decide whether the paramecium will eat, swim, or reproduce based on its available energy and the amount of energy required for each activity; and 2) Learn about cellular processes that require energy. In topic 2, students follow energy conversions in Euglena, during photosynthesis, respiration, and cellular work. Students will: 1)review definitions and properties of endergonic and exergonic processes; 2) explain, in qualitative terms, free energy changes in the universe, photosynthesis, respiration and cell work; and 3) identify the type of work (chemical, mechanical, etc.) being done in a number of cellular processes. In topic 3, students solve a mystery: where does ATPâs energy go in the glutamine synthetase reaction? Students will: 1) âinterviewâ molecules to learn how ATPâs energy was released and absorbed in the ATP-coupled reaction; 2) reconstruct events leading to and from a high energy reaction intermediate; 3) identify which molecules (reactants, products, enzyme) got some of ATPâs energy. In topic 4, students learn what enzymes can and cannot do in a reaction by âhiringâ an enzyme for the âjobâ of catalyst from a set of candidates that may be exaggerating their âqualifications.â Students will: 1) evaluate the claims of each enzyme to determine if they violate the chemical and thermodynamic properties of enzymes; and 2) select the âcandidateâ who is honest about what a catalyst can do in a reaction. In topic 5, students compare the energetics of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and cellular work. Students will: 1) complete a review table that summarizes the energy inputs, outputs, free energy change, etc. of these processes; 2) review free energy change, ?G, enzyme involvement, energy input and output.";Simulation;English;Medio bassa;;90-120;['College General Ed'];18;20;
