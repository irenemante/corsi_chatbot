 Numerical Models,https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2022/lessons/11,14+,"In this lesson, students participate in an unplugged activity simulating a zombie outbreak. Students must predict which parts of town have the least amount of zombies using data from a neighboring town. Students will use degrees of similarity and averages to make predictions about the number of zombies at a particular location. Then, students are rescued and get to compare their predictions to the actual numbers as a way to discuss how accuracy is different for numerical data compared to categorical data.",Testo,Media,30-60,Inglese,"['unplugged activity simulating', 'numerical data compared', 'students must predict', 'zombies using data', 'categorical data']"

 Customizing Apps,https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2022/lessons/13,14+,"In this lesson, students will explore how to customize the code of their app to make additional changes to the design of their app. They will start by exploring a single-screen app and then practice expanding the app to two-screens and updating the code to use the new design mode elements. After this, students help create a Driver Alert app that requires changes to the code using new design mode elements. Using the skills from this lesson, students will be able to create multi-screen apps where questions can appear on multiple screens instead of a single screen.",Esercizi,Media,30-60,Inglese,"['code using new design mode elements', 'new design mode elements', 'make additional changes', 'multiple screens instead', 'driver alert app']"
 AI Code of Ethics,https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2022/lessons/14,14+,"In small groups, students conduct research using articles and videos that expose ethical pitfalls in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) area of their choice. Afterward, each group develops at least one solution-oriented principle that addresses their chosen area. These principles are then assembled into a class-wide “Our AI Code of Ethics” resource (e.g. a slide presentation, document, or webpage) for AI creators and legislators everywhere.",Testo,Media,30-60,Inglese,"['students conduct research using articles', 'least one solution', 'expose ethical pitfalls', 'ethics ” resource', 'wide “']"
 Project: Make a Machine Learning App,https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2022/lessons/15,14+,"In this one or two day mini-project, students apply their skills from the unit so far and create a machine learning app using real-world data. Students are provided with several real-world datasets from a variety of contexts, and they choose which dataset they would like to investigate. They train and save their model, then make a simple App Lab app that uses the model. This mini-project is an opportunity to assess how well students can use features to create accurate machine learning models, and how well they can create apps that use machine learning.",Quiz,Media,30-60,Inglese,"['machine learning app using real', 'create accurate machine learning models', 'simple app lab app', 'use machine learning', 'two day mini']"
 Issue Statements,https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2022/lessons/16,14+,"This is the first of a five-day sequence of lessons that prepare students for the final project. In this lesson, students meet a team of fictional students who want to use machine learning to address an issue in their community. Students participate in an issue brainstorm using the 5 Why's strategy, then they help evaluate the ideas that the other student team came up with. The steps students take in this lesson are identical to the steps students will take in their final project.",Testo,Media,30-60,Inglese,"['use machine learning', 'student team came', 'issue brainstorm using', 'steps students take', 'steps students']"
 Survey Planning,https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2022/lessons/17,14+,"This is the second in a five-day sequence of lessons that prepare students for the final project. In this lesson, students learn that the other team of students would like to create a club recommender app based on the clubs at their school. Students imagine what questions would be most useful to help make this recommendation, then they learn how to use a Google Form template to create a survey. The steps students take in this lesson are identical to the steps students will take in their final project.",Testo,Media,30-60,Inglese,"['club recommender app based', 'google form template', 'students would like', 'steps students take', 'steps students']"
 Survey Data in AI Lab,https://studio.code.org/s/aiml-2022/lessons/18,14+,"This is the third in a five-day sequence of lessons that prepare students for the final project. In this lesson, students learn how to view survey data in Google Sheets and save the data to their computer as a csv file. Then, they upload the saved data to AI Lab and examine the survey results from one of the students to train a model using their data. Then, students use Google Sheets to examine data from another student where the data has errors and then try to fix the errors. The steps students take in this lesson are identical to the steps students will take in their final project, and the problem-solving strategies they develop will help them overcome challenges in their own final project.",Testo,Media,30-60,Inglese,"['students use google sheets', 'view survey data', 'steps students take', 'google sheets', 'steps students']"

After looking at a sample app, students follow a project guide to complete this multi-day activity. In the first step, students prepare the data they will use to train their model in AI Lab. After training, testing, and generating a model card, they export their model into App Lab for development.
